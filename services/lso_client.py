    When providing this method with an inventory, the format should be compatible with the Ansible YAML-based format.
    For example, an inventory consisting of two hosts, which each a unique host variable assigned to them looks as
    follows:

    .. code-block:: json

        "inventory": {
            "all": {
                "hosts": {

            }

    .. warning::
       Note the fact that the collection of all hosts is a dictionary, and not a list of strings. Ansible expects each
       host to be a key-value pair. The key is the :term:`FQDN` of a host, and the value always ``null``.

    The extra vars can be a simple dict consisting of key-value pairs, for example:

    .. code-block:: json

        "extra_vars": {
            "dry_run": true,
            "commit_comment": "I am a robot!",

    :param str callback_route: The endpoint at which :term:`GSO` expects a callback to continue the workflow executing
                               this step.
    :param dict[str, Any] inventory: An inventory of machines at which the playbook is targeted. Must be in
                                     YAML-compatible format.
    :param dict[str, Any] extra_vars: Any extra variables that the playbook relies on. This can include a subscription
                                      object, a boolean value indicating a dry run, a commit comment, etc.
